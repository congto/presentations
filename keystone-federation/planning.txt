Proposal:

OpenStack Identity and Federation

Keystone is the central authentication and authorization point for OpenStack.
Already it handles managing users via LDAP and SQL however as OpenStack and the
number of possible identity sources grows Keystone is evolving to rely
primarily on external sources of identity using protocols like SAML.
Keystone's role then becomes one of pure authorization and mapping those
identities into an OpenStack context.

For the unfamiliar we'll start with a quick recap of the role of Keystone and
the permission models of OpenStack, then look at the challenges of handling
many distinct authentication sources and the in-development changes required
for federated identity providers.



Planning:

- Keystone overview
- What is federation, why do we want it
- Keystone as a source of identity
- Keystone as a mapping of identity
- Authentication vs Authorization
- SAML workflow

- Flow:
  - SAML diagrams
- Components
  - IdP discovery
  - Mapping

- Where are we today
- What's coming up.
